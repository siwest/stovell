This is an exercise to develop Stock and Portfolio classes that generate statistics. The stock portfolio code here creates relative strength and quantile index statistics from a random number of stocks and a random number of days, with prices randomly generated. Again, this is just an exercise. *Enjoy!*

Run the exercise with the following command in terminal.

```bash
python stovell/stock_portfolio.py
```

Run a simple unit test with the following command in terminal.

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test.py
```
